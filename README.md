<h2>What Is Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>

According to Wikipedia, Reinforcement Learning (RL) 'is an area of machine learning concerned with software taking actions so as to maximize a cumulative reward.'  Ultimately, RL is about 'building code that can perform complex tasks by itself.'  Deep Reinforcement Learning extends on the aforementioned 'by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.'

<h2>Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree</h2>

This nanodegree teaches cutting-edge Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms â€” from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex tasks, and to build a robust portfolio of Deep Reinforcement Learning projects.  Nanodegree milestones include three projects, all of which have detailed requirements and instructions and all of which use the Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) toolkit

<h1>Collaboration and Competition (3rd Project)</h1>

The second project requires training an agent to maintain the position of double-jointed arm at the target location for as many time steps as possible.  To be considered successful, the agent must be able to receive an average of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

Two options are available to solve the environment:  Either a single agent must received an average reward of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes or multiple agents must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive scores and over all agents.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

The code must be written in PyTorch and Python 3.
